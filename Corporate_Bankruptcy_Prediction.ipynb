    "Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or corporate entities who cannot repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts. Bankruptcy is often initiated by the debtor, making the use of predictive modeling a major tool in the finance industry to save costs associated with bankruptcy. Early detections allow creditors to analyze their own risk and help mitigate unwanted transactions beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The detection of bankruptcy benefits creditors, investors, shareholders, partners, and even buyers and suppliers as a measure of financial health, as well as impacting many facets of the financial market, making bankruptcy prediction a longstanding issue within finance, accounting, and management science. The coronavirus pandemic has placed increased stress on financial markets and businesses alike due to many different economic factors, furthering the importance of development of machine learning models in predicting financial indicators such as bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explore and compare the performance of new and legacy machine learning models with a history of use in the financial industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal from the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the definition given by business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\n",

    "First, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis by running descriptive statistics, and visualizing our data. This allows us to understand our data before we feed it into our machine learning model, and examine it closely for any outliers or potential problems such as missing values that may effect predictive accuracy. Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial component to developing any data science project, and is considered an iterative process."

This could be due to missing data on a large number of the companies filled as 0, or the companies could have low tax rates due to other economic factors. We can also see some definite outliers in the distribution notably at the upper end with some values displaying 100 percent tax rates. Notably, the distribution is not normal. We will still process the outliers and gain what we can from the data instead of discarding it, through winsorization, during the next data cleaning phase."

    "Looking at the heatmaps other features of interest in regards to our target variable of bankruptcy, we can see that the Net Income to Total Assets is showing roughly a normal distribution. This is also known as Return on Assets (ROA) and is a financial ratio that shows the percentage of profit a company earns in relation to its overall resources. Most companies listed have a net income to total asset ratio of 0.8. Notably this financial ratio shows strong correlation to our target variable as one would expect when considering the factors involved in declaring bankruptcy."

The use of logistic regression for bankruptcy prediction can be traced back to almost 50 years ago when use began in the 1970's. It is still useful in some cases, but has seen less use in recent years as machine learning models grow in complexity and performance capabilities such as the advent of decision trees, neural networks, and SVM in the 1990's. Logistic Regression Classification is also known as a linear classifier."

    "Great, we have boosted model performance significantly in comparison to our Decision Tree model with an overall boost in weighted average scoring and accuracy scoring of about 3%. This demonstrates that Random Forest modeling can perform better than Decision Trees but at the cost of a longer runtime and increased computational costs. In this case, as a financial instrument and tool to detect bankruptcy, this increased performance is well worth the increased runtime. Although it might seem like a minor improvement in performance for increased computational costs, the money that could be saved from detecting just one additional bankruptcy would easily outset the cost of running the model continuously. This is why hyperparameter tuning is a must for running a computationally complex model such as Random Forest."

Notably we increased performance by 2% with our hyperparameter search when we were already at 96% accuracy which is great performance in this business use case. Our model performance is almost perfect at roughly 99% accuracy using XGBoost. The only downside is the increased runtime but this is a worthy tradeoff. This showcases the abilities of XGBoost to predict accurately using complex datasets and why it is considered to be a top performing machine learning algorithm."

    "The logistic regression classification model without any feature selection was having a difficult time predicting bankruptcy, with low levels of recall and accuracy notably of about 53%. This is a significant performance increase, with an accuracy scoring of roughly 86% and consistent cross-validation scoring. Runtime is also significantly reduced from a previous runtime without feature selection of 1.1 seconds, to 0.063 seconds with SelectKBest feature selection. This is a runtime decrease of around 94% while signficantly increasing performance. This demonstrates that the most computationally intensive option will not always provide the best results and data preparation is key for some models performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By refining the data with SelectKBest feature selection, we have shown the importance of eliminating noise from the dataset for some models such as logistic regression. Since logistic regression looks for a linearly separable decision boundary, it makes since that our initial model was having a difficult time finding a linear boundary within so many data points without feature selection.\n",

This is a significant performance increase, with an accuracy scoring of roughly 86% and consistent cross-validation scoring. Runtime is also significantly reduced from a previous runtime without feature selection of 1.1 seconds, to 0.063 seconds with SelectKBest feature selection. This is a runtime decrease of around 94% while signficantly increasing performance. This demonstrates that the most computationally intensive option will not always provide the best results and data preparation is key for some models performance.\n",

    "XGBoost uses an ensemble of decision trees and a regularization term to create models that perform well in the wild. The regularization is one part most tree packages treat less carefully, or simply ignore, which is what makes XGBoost unique.\n",

We will first build a model without hyperparameter tuning to see what results we get and then implement a RandomizedSearchCV function to find the best combination of parameters."

    "In conclusion I was able to create an accurate and inexpensive model that performed with 99% accuracy using XGBoost, showing the importance of adopting new technologies and new modeling capabilities to tackle real world business and financial problems like bankruptcy prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our random forest also saw similar success, it was not able to reach the levels of performance that XGBoost gave us on the feature selected datasets and non-selected dataset. XGBoost had little reduction in performance in comparison to other models when feature selection was done on the input variables. It allowed us to save about 5 seconds of runtime but at the loss of about.02% accuracy, but in comparison to our other models performance it preserved the predictive capabilites very well when dealing with lost or transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model performed exceptionally well with a consistent cross-validation scoring, meaning the model should be able to handle incoming new data well and perform within the same range in the wild. Without feature selection we had the most predictive capabilites but at the longest run time. With this business use case it makes most sense to not worry about minute runtimes such as 40 seconds. That is not a long time at all to run the model and detect companies at risk of bankruptcy within nearly 99% accuracy and will save a lot of money in the long run with such a high degree of predictive accuracy. As the model continues to evolve and collect more data in production we should expect to see predictive capabilities increase as well. "

    "   faster, more informed decisions.\n",

    "   indicators shift over time (post-COVID leverage ratios, interest rate regimes).\n",
    "   Implement quarterly retraining and feature distribution monitoring.\n",

    "5. **Feature engineering opportunities:** Ratio-based features (debt-to-equity trends,\n",
