        "Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or corporate entities who cannot repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts. Bankruptcy is often initiated by the debtor, making the use of predictive modeling a major tool in the finance industry to save costs associated with bankruptcy. Early detections allow creditors to analyze their own risk and help mitigate unwanted transactions beforehand. \n",

        "The detection of bankruptcy benefits creditors, investors, shareholders, partners, and even buyers and suppliers as a measure of financial health, as well as impacting many facets of the financial market, making bankruptcy prediction a longstanding issue within finance, accounting, and management science. The coronavirus pandemic has placed increased stress on financial markets and businesses alike due to many different economic factors, furthering the importance of development of machine learning models in predicting financial indicators such as bankruptcy.\n",

It is still useful in some cases, but has seen less use in recent years as machine learning models grow in complexity and performance capabilities such as the advent of decision trees, neural networks, and SVM in the 1990's.

This demonstrates that Random Forest modeling can perform better than Decision Trees but at the cost of a longer runtime and increased computational costs. In this case, as a financial instrument and tool to detect bankruptcy, this increased performance is well worth the increased runtime. Although it might seem like a minor improvement in performance for increased computational costs, the money that could be saved from detecting just one additional bankruptcy would easily outset the cost of running the model continuously. This is why hyperparameter tuning is a must for running a computationally complex model such as Random Forest."

        "The results offered by this dataset and XGBoost ensemble method are very similar to the random forest models performance, but XGBoost offers a stronger result and performance. Notably we increased performance by 2% with our hyperparameter search when we were already at 96% accuracy which is great performance in this business use case. Our model performance is almost perfect at roughly 99% accuracy using XGBoost. The only downside is the increased runtime but this is a worthy tradeoff. This showcases the abilities of XGBoost to predict accurately using complex datasets and why it is considered to be a top performing machine learning algorithm."

        "\n",
        "While our random forest also saw similar success, it was not able to reach the levels of performance that XGBoost gave us on the feature selected datasets and non-selected dataset. XGBoost had little reduction in performance in comparison to other models when feature selection was done on the input variables. It allowed us to save about 5 seconds of runtime but at the loss of about.02% accuracy, but in comparison to our other models performance it preserved the predictive capabilites very well when dealing with lost or transformed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The XGBoost model performed exceptionally well with a consistent cross-validation scoring, meaning the model should be able to handle incoming new data well and perform within the same range in the wild. Without feature selection we had the most predictive capabilites but at the longest run time. With this business use case it makes most sense to not worry about minute runtimes such as 40 seconds. That is not a long time at all to run the model and detect companies at risk of bankruptcy within nearly 99% accuracy and will save a lot of money in the long run with such a high degree of predictive accuracy. As the model continues to evolve and collect more data in production we should expect to see predictive capabilities increase as well. "
